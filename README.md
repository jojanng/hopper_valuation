This is a python project for analyzing options and stocks prices using the Fast Fourier Transform based Carr-Madan model approach, Discounted Cash Flow model and multiples.

**Introduction**

Pricing analysis of stocks and options across exchanges involves integrating market trends, historical volatility, risk-free rates, and valuation models such as DCF, multiples, and implied volatility methods to estimate fair values across varying strikes, maturities, and fundamentals.

**Documentation**

FFT frameworks: Black-Scholes, Implied Volatility Curves, Risk‐Neutral Density Extraction, Heston (stochastic volatility), Merton / Kou (jump–diffusion), Bates (jump–diffusion + stochastic vol), Sensitivity Analysis (Greeks),  Full Strike Surface

**Getting started**
