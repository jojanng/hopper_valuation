**TODO**

-**COMPLETED** prediction of single expected stock price (only for mu)
-**COMPLETED** intrinsic value calculator using DCF model (*revision might be needed*)
    analyzing price movements or earnings surprises using FFT will improve accuracy of intrinsic value model to detect longterm trend

-graphs: density x % and stock price prediction x pdf (full distribution)

-write in documentation: differences between the both prediction algo
   carr madan fft uses fft to compute option and probabilities distributions and stock_price_algo predicts the stock price expected value at T

-**PARTIALLY COMPLETED** design website and functions (track options, predict stocks, easy technical analysis on stocks, etc)
